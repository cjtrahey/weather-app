## General info
This project was made with the intent of further crafting our knowledge and usage of APIS through the usage and creation of a weather dashboard application.
<br><p>
The outline objectives of the project were: <p>
* Call an API (OpenWeather in this instance)
* Display data from the API based on which entry was given
* Store the data locally in order for it to be retrieved later

## Technologies
Project is created with: <br>
* CSS
* HTML
* JavaScript
	
## Resources
* https://openweathermap.org/api

## Troubleshooting
The following issues arose during the activity, some of which weren't able to be solved in this website mockup. <br>
* Although my understanding of JS was improved from last week's assignment, the knowledge gap between where I am now with it versus where I should be at this point in time is a serious issue, which can only be solved through dedication to instill the processes. However, due to recent developments, I have had a significantly less amount of time to not only grasp an understanding, but also being able to use such knowledge when it is required.
* One function in the script is undefined for unknown reasons, leading up to a non-functioning item.
